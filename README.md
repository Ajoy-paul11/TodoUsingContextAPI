# Todo App with React and Vite

This project is a simple yet powerful Todo application built using React and Vite. It allows users to add, delete, update, and toggle the completion status of todo items. The app uses localStorage to save the state of your todos, ensuring that your data persists even after the browser is closed or refreshed. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a sleek, responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Allows users to add new tasks to their todo list.
- **Delete Todos**: Users can remove tasks they no longer need.
- **Update Todos**: Users can edit the text of existing todos.
- **Toggle Completion**: Users can mark todos as complete or incomplete.
- **Persistence**: Todos are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A modern, fast build tool for JavaScript and CSS.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **localStorage**: Web storage API used for storing data locally within the user's browser.
